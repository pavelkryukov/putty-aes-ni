# PuTTY-AES-NI

PuTTY-AES-NI is a PuTTY fork that uses Intel AES-NI ISA extension. The developers team consisted of:
 * [Pavel Kryukov](https://github.com/pavelkryukov)
 * [Maxim Kuznetsov](https://github.com/mkuznets)

To keep PuTTY-AES-NI easily mergeable with PuTTY, repositories were separated:
 * Main PuTTY-AES-NI repository: https://github.com/pavelkryukov/putty-aes-ni2
 * Stuff for testing and demonstration + detailed changelist: https://github.com/pavelkryukov/putty-aes-ni

Project is made as [MIPT Cryptography course project](http://mipt.ru/education/chair/radio_engineering/infsec/), team demonstrated results on [55th MIPT Conference](http://conf55.mipt.ru/info/main/), "Radio Engineering and Cryptography" section and got a "Best Presentation of Section" achievement.
