  # `svn co https://putty-aes-ni.googlecode.com/svn/trunk .`
  # or have local copy without *.exe Ð¸ *.txt
  # `cd aestest`
  # `./run.sh -p`
  # Be sure that CPU supports AES-NI (Checking for AES-NI support... found)
  # Wait...
  # There are 2 new files, perf-original.txt and perf-output.txt. First one is for standard version, second is for AES-NI version.

= Comments =

  # Format of output files is following: ||code||keylen||blocklen||time||
  # Codes: ||0 - encryption||1 - decryption||2 - sdctr||
  # By default, optimization of both AES algorithms is disabled, to turn it on, change $(NOOPT) to $(OPT) in Makefile.
